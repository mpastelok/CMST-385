                Pink Floyd were a British rock band formed in London in 1965. They became known for pushing the boundaries of rock music through experimental, psychedelic sounds, and later, large-scale concept albums. Early on, the band gained attention for their unique blend of blues, spacey instrumentals, and imaginative songwriting, which helped set them apart from other groups of the time.

                As their sound evolved, Pink Floyd became one of the most influential bands of the 1970s. Albums like <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> and <em>Wish You Were Here</em> explored themes such as time, mental health, and conflict, while introducing immersive studio production techniques. Their music, visuals, and live performances helped shape progressive rock and left a lasting impact on modern music.
