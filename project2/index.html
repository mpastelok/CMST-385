        <h2>Project Concept</h2>
        <p>
            This project involves the creation of a <strong>professional portfolio website</strong> as a visual designer. The website will showcase projects I created using Adobe Photoshop, with a focus on strong composition, mood, and visual storytelling. The portfolio will serve as a centralized space to present my creative work in a clean, organized, and engaging way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary objective of the website is to present my visual design work in a professional manner that highlights both my technical skill and creative intent. The goal of the website is to spark <em>curiosity</em> and <em>inspiration</em> in visitors, encouraging them to explore individual projects and ultimately reach out for employment opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intended audience for this website includes <strong>potential employers</strong> and <strong>clients</strong> who are interested in creative services. These viewers may be seeking examples of past work, insight into my creative approach, or a way to make contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website will include the following key features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A clear and consistent navigation at the top of all pages.</li>
            <li>A Home page that introduces me and highlights my selected projects.</li>
            <li>Individual project pages that allow visitors to focus on one project at a time.</li>
            <li>An About Me page that provides brief background information.</li>
            <li>A Contact page with a contact form and other communication options.</li>
        </ul>
