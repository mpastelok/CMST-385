        <h2>Project Concept</h2>
        <p>
            This project involves the creation of a <strong>professional portfolio website</strong> as a visual designer. The website will showcase projects I created using Adobe Photoshop, with a focus on strong composition, mood, and visual storytelling. The portfolio will serve as a centralized space to present my creative work in a clean, organized, and engaging way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary objective of the website is to present my visual design work in a professional manner that highlights both my technical skill and creative intent. The goal of the website is to spark <em>curiosity</em> and <em>inspiration</em> in visitors, encouraging them to explore individual projects and ultimately reach out for employment opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intended audience for this website includes <strong>potential employers</strong> and <strong>clients</strong> who are interested in creative services. These viewers may be seeking examples of past work, insight into my creative approach, or a way to make contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website will include the following key <u>features</u>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A clear and consistent navigation at the top of all pages.</li>
            <li>A Home page that introduces me and highlights my selected projects.</li>
            <li>Individual project pages that allow visitors to focus on one project at a time.</li>
            <li>An About Me page that provides brief background information.</li>
            <li>A Contact page with a contact form and other communication options.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" title="W3Schools Tutorials" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> (HTML and CSS tutorials)</h3>
        <p>
            W3Schools will be used as my main reference for proper HTML5 structure and CSS implementation. This resource will help ensure the website follows correct syntax and validates without errors.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3uCSh6LIY0" title="How to create a CSS navigation bar in 6 minutes!" target="_blank">How to create a CSS navigation bar in 6 minutes!</a> (YouTube tutorial)</h3>
        <p>
            A video tutorial on creating a CSS-based dropdown navigation menu will be used to help implement the “My Work” hover menu that link to individual project pages. This resource will assist with understanding hover states, layout, and acceptable positioning.
        </p>

        <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
        <p>
            Adobe Photoshop will be used to edit and optimize all project images for web use. Images will be resized and compressed to meet requirements while maintaining visual quality and consistency throughout the website.
